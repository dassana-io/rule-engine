      Please do not use GitHub Issues for asking questions. Instead, if you have a general question about Dassana we encourage you to post on our [Slack workspace](https://dassana.io) or on [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/dassana-io/dassana/discussions) instead of this issue tracker. The maintainers and other community members can provide help and answer your questions there.
      
      Please keep in mind that many of Dassana's core and expert developers prefer to handle support queries through [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/dassana-io/dassana/discussions), since the non-realtime format encourages more structured and fully-formed questions. Asking questions on GitHub Discussions requires more up-front effort, but you may well find you get a better response as a result.
      
      If you've discovered a bug or would like to propose a feature request please use one of the other issue templates.
      
      Thanks!
